What I have done here;
* this is a project to show a timeline of Einstein's life
* used img element, ul, blockquote, a link with target _blank to open it on another page
* added some basic css properties, such as font-size, padding, background-color, margin, font-family etc.
* here you can see the work at: https://semihozturk.github.io/tributePage/
